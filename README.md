Hey! Currently trying to learn C# and .Net. Taught myself HTML when it was the new hotness (I was there Gandalf, I was there 3000 years ago), kept up with webdevelopment up until Flash became prevalent,
but that's where I fell of the coding-train. 
Got inspired to try out some JavaScript by a friend who went back to vocational-school a couple of years ago, instantly fell in love with programming again and realized that I wanted to go back to school 
too so here I am!
